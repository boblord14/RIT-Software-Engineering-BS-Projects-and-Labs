(do i even need to do this? unsure but id rather not lose points so here goes)


hash function: 
expected time- 10mins
plan- logic is basically given to me, right? I think all i need to do is just copy it in c code really

actual time- 5m
comments- was that easy

lookup function:
expected time- 20m
plan- bit more confusing on what to do this time around. basically just need to get a clear idea on how the hash function plays into it and beyond that its just a standard
traversal into matching specific value in a struct/pointer

actual time- 15m
comments- ran into a stupid error that was skill issue on my part with pointers, but beyond that it was straightforward when it clicked the list was a list of linked lists p much

drop function:
expected time- 20m
plan- just need to connect the prev/next pointers around the object where it was and then free the mem i think

actual time- 15m
comments- massive if else garbage block due to having to deal with front/end edge cases, no way around it unfortunately
ran into one error where i forgot that i needed to connect the hashmap slot to the next object in the linked list if there was one instead of just NULL-ing it out

Activity Journal- C Debug Part 2
Ethan Patterson

Initial Observations:

Estimated time to completion- 45mins

Plan-
 This program still isn't made properly, isn't it?

First step would be getting this thing running how it should be. 

After thats all nice and good then I can go back through and refactor it into the proper formatting where it isn't following that. 


---------------

Completion:

Actual time- 1 hour

Remarks-

Killed some more bugs and gave it some fresh documentation. 

Super big input numbers in the thousands will segfault it, dont know an easy solution to that yet. I did up the size of the prime array from 15 to 1028 to hopefully give it some more wiggle room when it comes to that. 

Not the worst to do. The "coding standards" part felt a tad vague but I tried my best to do them by what I could find.

Start
Estimated Time	1H 0M
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
Actual work doesnt seem too hard. just a matter of understanding the pointer work again as per usual. 


Complete
Actual Time	4H MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Overshot my time estimate due to massive skill issue. Stupid errors that weren't really related to the project but more me just screwing up simple things
and taking forever to notice what I did. 

Had one error in filter_any_index that took me like 2 hours to resolve, I asked chris and he couldnt figure it out either. The solution was really stupid. I bet money I tried it too and it didnt work before
but for some reason it works fine now. 

The actual pointer and memory work came pretty easily. Occasional error but I caught all of those quickly, valgrind helped a lot and was pretty straightforward once I learned where to see my issue in all the stuff it spits out. 

Had to nut up and port my project off of nitron and to the jetbrains c ide so I could have the nicer more visual debugger for fixing the bugs I was having. Made it a lot faster, its just a pain to set up the 
project because the structure for that ide is weird.

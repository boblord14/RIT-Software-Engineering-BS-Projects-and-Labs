Name: Ethan Patterson

================================================================
Start Part 1
Estimated Time	0H 30M

Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Figure out how to go about compiling and running programs with c/unix in general
Figure out basic syntax and how it differes from how I percieve it
Write out the function
Test/bugfix
Compile final and submit


Complete
Actual Time	0H 20M
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

5 compiler errors total

Didnt realize I could hit the up arrow to just run the last command or a couple commands back, made testing much faster

Int arethmatic is all ints, said that in the instructions but it didn't click until I tried dividing 5/9 and kept getting 0 as my final result

The printf string format is a bit funky but not the worst

================================================================
Start Part 2
Estimated Time	0H 10M
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Figure out how floats work(99% sure its just casting like java was)
Impliment the float edition

Complete
Actual Time	0H 10M
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

2 compiler errors total

Changing/casting stuff to floats was the easy part. Took me a minute to look through the lecture stuff to find out how to round the decimal to one place for the outputs.

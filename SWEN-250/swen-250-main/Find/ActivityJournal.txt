================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	1H MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
just get started on them in the order theyre listed. the array variant
should be pretty easy, pointer shouldnt be awful too its just a matter of remembering how syntax for it works


Complete
Actual Time	0h 45m
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
a lot easier than I expected, it all just sort of worked right every time i made something. no major issues and the methods I thought of to impliment each function worked perfectly every time 
(except for some small syntax errors but thats expected in the process of writing stuff)

getting better at pointer shenanigans too which is nice.

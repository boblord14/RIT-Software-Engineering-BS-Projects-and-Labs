Figure out what its even asking me to do

Figure out pointer syntax

Inevetably screw up pointer syntax and figure out what went wrong

Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
I feel theres a more efficient method to read stdin into the char array for the string but idk 

it just works though. syntax wasnt as bad as I thought, although im still struggling to see the direct use for pointers even though I do know there has to be something.

================================================================
Part 1
Estimated Time	00 30m
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
This is just simple "read line, toss in char array, no?" 

like a 1 line job with fgets and maybe some other stuff for the "return -1" bit or something


Complete
Actual Time	0H 15m
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
It was that easy



================================================================
Part 2
Estimated Time	0H 30M
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Just compare shenanigans with strlen I think and maybe some sort of easy copy function

Complete
Actual Time	1H 0M

Realized my read was wrong as it needed to return the line length not the length of the cut part(if cut) which seriously overcomplicated it

I then proceeded to waste my time even further by compiling it under the wrong name and then wondering why my changes werent fixing the program when I ran it.

The actual work wasn't bad at all, I was just stupid.

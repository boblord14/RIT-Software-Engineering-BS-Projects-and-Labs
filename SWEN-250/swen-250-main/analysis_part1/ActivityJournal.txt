Implement these functions in the order below.

Your name: Ethan Patterson

================================================================
create_node
Start
Estimated Time	1H 0M
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
figure out the struct and memalloc shenanigans and how they work together with pointers

should fall into place from there

Complete
Actual Time	1H 30M
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
minor skill issue with using sizeof(string) instead of strlen(string) for malloc screwing me up

================================================================
add_node_at_head
Start
Estimated Time	1H 0M
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
barring any dumb shenanigans where im sitting there for an hour until i realize i mistyped a single thing, shouldnt
be harder than the previous one

Complete
Actual Time	30H 0M
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
understanding the whole project more, pointer shenanigans coming really easy to me now

================================================================
clear_linked_list
Start
Estimated Time	0H 20M
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
find a smooth way to iterate over the whole list and this is basically finished

Complete
Actual Time	HH 10M
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
took a bit of thinking to get the while loop perfected but it just works

================================================================
add_node_after_current
Start
Estimated Time	0H 45M
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
toning down my time estimates now that im working smoothly.
pretty similar to some of the other work i did, might be really really easy if copy pasting with a few renames here
and there works out.

Complete
Actual Time	0H 20M
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
copypaste did most of the job for me. had to do some ifs to handle cases of things being null at times, which was a bit
weird to think my way though. overall not particulary bad though.

================================================================
find_word
Start
Estimated Time	1H 0M
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
time estimate right back up because theres 3 whole categories of unit tests for this one function, probably gonna
be messy.

Complete
Actual Time	HH 15m
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
wait a minute that was all?

went really easy, guess im just grasping how to do this properly

reused a little bit of loop logic to loop through the full list, and just was able to utilize the strcmp output
to do most of the heavy lifting for me. had to crunch out a couple segfaults that were solely the error of me not ordering
my null checks in the proper order(had the check if the first char was \0 before checking if the word was null in the first place)

beyond that I thiiiink thats all I have to do?

================================================================

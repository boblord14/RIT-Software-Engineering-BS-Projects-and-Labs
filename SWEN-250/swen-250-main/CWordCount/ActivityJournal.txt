Count chars and words by parsing the line

Complete
Actual Time	3H 00m
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Wasted most of the time trying to read in from file instead, and bashing my head against segfaults and other garbage.

Took about my original estimated time to scrap it and write it properly. 

Starting to get the hang of working through unix now, even if it is a tad more complicated for the same result compared to something like the jetbrains IDEs. 
Still, I dont mind it. 

Would love to figure out a read from file variant but thats a task for a day when I have more experience and freetime.

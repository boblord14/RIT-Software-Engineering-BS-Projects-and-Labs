This course was my first computing college course at RIT. It is an accelerated version of computer science 1 and 2 condensed down into one semester, designed for students with AP credit, which I had. 

The first few labs and project 1 were python, and the rest of the course was project 2. Later on labs became more of the focus rather than lecture code or recitation excersizes, so those are much more well organized here.

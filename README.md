This repository is a copy of all the work I have done for every Software Engineering/Computer Science course I have taken during my time at RIT. 

Each folder for every class has another readme file in it detailing the course, what I did, the code included in them, and my final grade in the class.

This repository is updated periodically as I write more code for my classes, and as of 12/19/2023 is still being updated when something changes from time to time. 

Once again, click on an indivudal class folder in this repository to learn more about each class.

Repo for CSEC-202- Reverse Engineering Fundamentals. 

The HDSetup.exe.i64 file is the IDA database for a variant of the KRBanker/Malware. 

It is fully commentated where it matters, and all functions of any importances in it are properly named, allowing for a very easy time working through the control flow of the malware. 

## **NOTE: DO NOT RUN THE ACTUAL EXECUTABLE CONTAINED WITHIN THE I64 FILE. IT IS LEGITIMATE MALWARE. WHILE THE KNOWN FUNCTIONALITY MAY NOT BE DAMAGING TO YOUR COMPUTER, THERE IS ALWAYS A RISK**

My complete analysis writeup of the malware is also included here in pdf form. This one is, in fact, safe to download :)

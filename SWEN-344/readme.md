This is a copy of my repo for SWEN-344, Web Engineering. As of 9/26/23 I am currently in this class. The files in here are the current state of the repo. When the class concludes I will seperate them into each indivudal assignment due date so a more obvious work progression is visible, not just the final/current prodcut. 

This class deals with database management through DB SQL queries via postgres, Rest APIs, and React to create fully functional webpages.

The database project in the repo demonstrates a functional chat database designed to work much like discord or slack. It includes the full database schema, an api to make easy calls to and from it, and a suite of test cases to verify that the api is functional. 

The database exam deals with a different database project of similar design to the chat one but with a different design/schema to it.

The rest project builds off the database project's chat system, designing rest apis that can handle requests to create, retrieve, update, and delete data on the server. These use querystrings or arguments in the request body to accomplish that, and use a flask based system to create the apis. 

The rest exam is much like the database exam. Similar design, different scenario. 

The client project is signifigantly more bulky. It contains multiple react projects, and one or two non-react projects. The non react projects are basic HTML webpage design using html/css/javascript. They were proof of concepts that we did for web client design basics. After that, it shifted into porting our work over to react, and using reactstrap/bootstrap with modals, cards, forms, buttons, state work, etc to make everything work smoothly. 

The final part of the client project(client 4) was full stack. This involved writing rest apis and database schema/commands to hook everything together. The end product was a fully functional react webpage using react/reactstrap for the frontend, rest apis via flask to transfer data, and a postgresql based database to store and retrieve data as needed. Everything interacts seamlessly and functions perfectly.

The react final exam was a full stack exam, and once more is similar in design to the full stack client project, just with a new scenario for the exam.

This is a copy of my repo for SWEN-344, Web Engineering. As of 9/26/23 I am currently in this class. The files in here are the current state of the repo. When the class concludes I will seperate them into each indivudal assignment due date so a more obvious work progression is visible, not just the final/current prodcut. 

This class deals with database management through DB SQL queries via postgres, Rest APIs, and React to create fully functional webpages. Currently I am in the DB management portion of the class.

The project in the repo demonstrates a functional chat database designed to work much like discord or slack. It includes the full database schema, an api to make easy calls to and from it, and a suite of test cases to verify that the api is functional.

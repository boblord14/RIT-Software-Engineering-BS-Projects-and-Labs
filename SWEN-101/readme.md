This is a copy of my team repo from my software engineering seminar class, SWEN-101, from Fall 2022. It is the only software engineering course I took that semester. 

We worked in a team learning and following along with the steps of creating a straightforward project using software engineering Agile and Scrum methods. 

I worked on a team with 4 other people during this, 2 of which contributed nothing to our project, while the others and I pulled more than our weight. 

I got an A in this class. The project is as is, and was not updated after we submitted it.

Note- the RIT login screen in the project when you run it looks real but is actually fake, please do not put in real credentials.

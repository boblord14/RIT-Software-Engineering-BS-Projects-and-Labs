This is a copy of my team repo from my intro to software engineering class, SWEN-261, from Spring 2023. I took this course alongside SWEN-250(personal software engineering). 

We worked in a team building off the principles of Scrum and Agile introduced in SWEN-101, and focused on also introducing principles of object oriented design and good software structures. 

I worked on a team with 3 other people to create and design a web based "e-store" to sell products. This featured an Angular based frontend for user interactions and processing, hooked up to a springboot/maven backend to store and retrieve data. The backend features full unit test coverage as well. 

This project was worked on over a series of 4 sprints, focusing on developing the backend, then the main features of the frontend required by the project, then custom features to make our project stand out, and finally documenting the whole app. 

I got an B+ in this class. The project is as is, and was not updated after we submitted it.
